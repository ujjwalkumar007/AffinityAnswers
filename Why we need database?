We need database beacause file's not very efficient at handling large amount of data and also the content a file is not indexed which is one of the main advantages 
of database over file storage. 
other advantages of database are:-
  >We can Insert a column or record in database.
  >We can Find a row based on any condition
  >We can Delete a row or rows from a databse
  >We can Sort rows on the basis of any column
